# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 1: World Development Statistics

### Overview

Our first module in DSI covers:
- Basic statistics and probability
- Many Python programming concepts
- Programmatically interacting with files and directories
- Visualizations
- EDA
- Working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting

You might wonder if you're ready to start doing data science. While you still have **tons** to learn, there are many aspects of the data science process that you're ready to tackle. Project 1 aims to allow you to practice and demonstrate these skills.

For our first project, we're going to take a look at World Development Statistics from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/about/), an independent Swedish foundation that aims to make data about the world more accessible and reliable. A good introduction on Gapminder is this [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) from Hans Rosling, which also shows how effective data visualization can be for your audience.


### Problem Statement

Generally speaking, you will be asked to come up with a data science problem. This problem is ultimately up to you, but below are some guidelines/things to consider when crafting a problem statement:
> 1. Consider your audience. Who is your project going to help? Who will your presentation be geared towards? Establishing your audience first can help you narrow down your scope.
> 2. Consider the data you will use. Based on the contents of this data, think about some questions you could reasonably answer. These questions should aim to solve some kind of problem.
> 3. Based on these questions, what would bring some kind value to your audience? This can be business insights, increase sales, make decisions, etc.
> 4. Put everything from the above steps together into a few sentences that describe the specific problem you are trying to solve and who it will benefit.
> [Here is a blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/defining-a-data-science-problem-4cbf15a2a461) about crafting a data science problem statement.

Here are some example prompts if you need inspiration:
> * Climate change will disproportionately affect countries at lower sea levels. In anctipation of sea level rise, you have been hired by a non-profit to identify which countries are most at risk and to report back the top 5 countries where relief and aid should be directed*.
> * You work for a global shipping company. Your higher ups have asked you to identify which countries (and mores specifically which cities) are the best candidates for expansion of port facilities. Your company is interested in countries that are developing quickly, as these ones will soon demand more goods imported via your company's shipping fleet. 
> * *Feel free to be creative with your own prompt!*

### Datasets

#### Provided Data

There are 3 datasets included in the [`data`](./data/) folder for this project. You are required to pick **at least two** of these to complete your analysis. Feel free to use more than two if you would like, or add other relevant datasets you find online. **Hint: The Gapminder website has way more datasets**



**Make sure you cross-reference your data with your data sources to eliminate any data collection or data entry issues.**

#### Additional Data
You are welcome to add any other data sources you find online to support your analysis, but this is **not required**.

### Deliverables

All of your projects will comprise of a written technical report and a presentation. As we continue in the course, your technical report will grow in complexity, but for this initial project it will comprise:
- A Jupyter notebook that describes your data with visualizations & statistical analysis.
- A README markdown file the provides an introduction to and overview of your project.
- Your presentation slideshow rendered as a .pdf file.
**NOTE**: Your entire Github repository will be evaluated as your technical report. Make sure that your files and directories are named appropriately, that all necessary files are included, and that no unnecessary or incomplete files are included.

For your first presentation, you'll be presenting to a **non-technical** audience. You should prepare a slideshow with appropriately scaled visuals to complement a compelling narrative. **Presentations shoud be about 5 minutes.**  Time tends to fly when presenting, and doing a dry run for a friend or family member is a great way to practice.

### Technical Report Starter Code

Future projects will require you to decide on the entire structure of your technical report. Here, we provide you with [starter code](./code/starter-code.ipynb) in a Jupyter notebook that will help to guide your data exploration and analysis. **If you choose to edit the core structure of this notebook, make sure you don't exclude any of the requested operations**.

### Style Guide and Suggested Resources

[Tim Dwyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtimdwyer/) (former DSI student and TA) put together [this style guide](./tim_style_guide.md). Some recommendations are geared toward future projects (which will include modeling and span multiple notebooks), but generally these are great recommendations.

Here's a link on [how to give a good lightning talk](https://www.semrush.com/blog/16-ways-to-prepare-for-a-lightning-talk/), which provides some good recommendations for short presentations.

[Here's a great summary](https://towardsdatascience.com/storytelling-with-data-a-data-visualization-guide-for-business-professionals-97d50512b407) of the main points of the book _Storytelling with Data_, which I can't recommend enough. [Here's a blog post](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/8/9/my-guiding-principles) by the author about his guiding principles for visualizations.

### Submission

**Materials must be submitted on December 1st**

Your technical report will be hosted on Github Enterprise. Make sure it includes:

- A README.md (that isn't this file)
- Jupyter notebook(s) with your analysis (renamed to describe your project)
- Data files
- Presentation slides
- Any other necessary files (images, etc.)

**Please fork the project, download or clone to your local machine, and submit a link in the [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/1/w/NjM3ODE0Mjc0MDc0/t/all) assignment.**

### Presentation Structure

**You must be ready to present your findings by the start of class on (insert date).**

- **Must be within time limit - not more than 5 minutes.**
- Use Google Slides or some other visual aid (Keynote, Powerpoint, etc).
- Consider the audience. Assume you are presenting to a non-technical audience.
- Start with the **data science problem**.
- Use visuals that are appropriately scaled and interpretable.
- Talk about your procedure/methodology (high level, **CODE IS ALWAYS INAPPROPRIATE FOR A NON-TECHNICAL AUDIENCE**).
- Talk about your primary findings.
- Make sure you provide **clear recommendations** that follow logically from your analyses and narrative and answer your data science problem.

Be sure to rehearse and time your presentation before class.

### Rubric
Your instructors will evaluate your project (for the most part) using the following criteria.  You should make sure that you consider and/or follow most if not all of the considerations/recommendations outlined below **while** working through your project.

**Scores will be out of 21 points based on the 7 items in the rubric.** <br>
*3 points per section*<br>

In order to pass the project, students must earn a minimum score of 1 for each category.
- Earning below a 1 in one or more of the above categories would result in a failing project.
- While a minimum of 1 in each category is the required threshold for graduation, students should aim to earn at least an average of 1.5 across each category. An average score below 1.5, while it may be passing, means students may want to solicit specific feedback in order to significantly improve the project before showcasing it as part of a portfolio or the job search.

### REMEMBER:

This is a learning environment and you are encouraged to try new things, even if they don't work out as well as you planned! While this rubric outlines what we look for in a _good_ project, it is up to you to go above and beyond to create a _great_ project. **Learn from your failures and you'll be prepared to succeed in the workforce**.
