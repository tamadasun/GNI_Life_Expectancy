 Project 1: World Development Statistics

### Overview

- Basic statistics and probability

- Working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting


For this first project, I m going to take a look at World Development Statistics from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/about/), an independent Swedish foundation that aims to make data about the world more accessible and reliable. A good introduction on Gapminder is this [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) from Hans Rosling, which also shows how effective data visualization can be for your audience.
